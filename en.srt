1
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:14,613
Ser Ryam was a strong lord commander
of the Kings guard,

2
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:18,200
but he was ill for some time.

3
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:21,203
- He passed in peace, I hope.
- Yes, Your Grace.

4
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:23,956
He was found to have passed gently
in his sleep.

5
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,668
His remains are being prepared
by the Silent Sisters.

6
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:31,088
The succeeding Lord Commander, Ser Harrold

7
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:35,593
would like to make haste in finding
Ser Ryam's replacement on the Kings guard.

8
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:38,521
Your Grace, my lords,
Kings guard must soon

9
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:41,348
be restored to its full
complement of seven.

10
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:46,687
With the help of the Hand, I have invited
a number of fine candidates to court.

11
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:48,939
All have passed fair trials.

12
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:56,614
Four ships have now been lost.
The last one was flying my banner.

13
00:02:57,281 --> 00:02:59,341
The Step stones have now
grown into a conflagration.

14
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:01,660
Yet you sit here and dither
about court business.

15
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:03,996
If you've something to discuss,
Lord Corlys...

16
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:07,750
I want to know what is to be done
about my ships and my men.

17
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,461
The crown will compensate you
for your ship and crew

18
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:12,974
and make an offering
to the men's families.

19
00:03:12,998 --> 00:03:14,757
I don't want compensation.

20
00:03:16,884 --> 00:03:20,804
I want to seize the Step stones by force
and burn out this Crabfeeder.

21
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,766
I am not prepared to start a war
with the Free Cities.

22
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:26,769
These pirates are not the Free Cities.

23
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:29,897
Who do you think provides them
with their ships and tender?

24
00:03:30,272 --> 00:03:32,024
In all of its history, my lord,

25
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:36,111
the Seven Kingdoms have never entered
open war with the Free Cities.

26
00:03:36,237 --> 00:03:40,199
Were that to happen,
the losses would be incalculable.

27
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:47,414
What reason does the Crabfeeder
have to fear us?

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,503
The king's own brother has been allowed
to seize Dragons tone

29
00:03:52,628 --> 00:03:55,464
and fortify it
with an army of his gold cloaks.

30
00:03:55,631 --> 00:04:00,302
Daemon has squatted there for over half a
year without even a protest from the crown.

31
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:03,180
I'll caution you, Lord Corlys:

32
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:07,226
a seat at the king's table
does not make you his equal.

33
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:12,356
I have acted, Corlys.

34
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:18,028
I've sent envoys to Pentos and Volantis
to see if we might find common cause.

35
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,615
Ships and men are at the ready.

36
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:25,286
The Step stones will be settled. In time.

37
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:28,289
You have dragon riders, father.

38
00:04:34,795 --> 00:04:36,171
Send us.

39
00:04:40,718 --> 00:04:43,637
It isn't that simple, Rhaenyra.

40
00:04:44,138 --> 00:04:48,100
- It would be a show of force.
- At least the princess has a plan.

41
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:53,498
I only meant that we should at least...

42
00:04:53,522 --> 00:04:59,194
Perhaps there's some better use
for the princess's talents, Your Grace

43
00:05:01,655 --> 00:05:03,791
Why don't you take the
princess to see about

44
00:05:03,815 --> 00:05:05,951
the new Kings guard
posting, Lord Commander?

45
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:09,913
A fine idea, Your Grace.

46
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,336
This knight will protect you as well.
You should choose.

47
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:40,235
Ser Desmond Car on,
a fine knight, princess.

48
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:42,446
Step forward, Ser Desmond.

49
00:05:44,698 --> 00:05:46,200
Son of Ser Royce Car on,

50
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:51,246
Ser Desmond has proved strong and steady
in both the tourney lists and without.

51
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:54,792
While traveling through the Kings wood
on his way to King's Landing,

52
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,671
Ser Desmond recently brought
a would-be poacher to justice.

53
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,310
You might thank him
for his leal service, princess.

54
00:06:13,435 --> 00:06:16,355
We thank you for your loyal service
to the crown, Ser

55
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:30,244
Ser Rymun Mallister.

56
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:35,374
Son of Lord Lymond Mallister of Seagard.

57
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,543
Winner of the melee of Cider Hall,

58
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:40,754
he was the last mounted of three
and-twenty knights.

59
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,965
Ser Rymun was knighted at eight-and-ten.

60
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,843
Have any of these knights
have combat experience?

61
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:48,637
Beyond capturing poachers.

62
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:58,689
Ser Criston Cole.

63
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:07,448
Son of the steward
of the Lord of Blackhaven.

64
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,244
Be welcome, Ser Criston.

65
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:15,789
You saw combat in the Storm lands?

66
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:17,958
Dornish Marches, princess.

67
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,587
I fought for a year as a foot-soldier
against the Dornish incursions.

68
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,047
Ser Arlan Dondarrion knighted me

69
00:07:24,173 --> 00:07:26,842
after we razed two of the watchtowers
along the Boneway.

70
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:34,266
I choose Ser Criston Cole.

71
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:37,853
Let's not be too hasty, princess.

72
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:41,815
There's no doubt Ser Criston
is a fine warrior,

73
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,862
but houses such as Crakehalls and Mallister
are important allies of the crown.

74
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:48,363
Seagard, for instance,

75
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:51,533
is the realm's prime defense
against reavers from the Iron Islands.

76
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:53,160
Those men are tourney knights.

77
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:57,080
My father should be defended by a man
who's known real combat.

78
00:07:58,957 --> 00:08:00,667
Should he not?

79
00:08:02,377 --> 00:08:04,171
Of course, princess

80
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:07,132
Well, let us plan Ser Criston's
investiture then.

81
00:08:15,307 --> 00:08:19,603
The Valyrian capitol was built into
a volcano, much like Dragons tone.

82
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:24,733
When the dragon lords,
the highest of the nobility lived here,

83
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,652
at the volcanic face,

84
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:29,655
closest to the source
of their magic and power.

85
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:36,286
And this was the Anogrion
where the blood mages worked their craft.

86
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:42,626
- It is truly wondrous what you've built.
- Oh, no.

87
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:46,713
I only pore over the histories
and provide the plans.

88
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:49,883
The stonemasons build the structures.

89
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:52,886
Do you believe that Westeros
can be another Valyria, Your Grace?

90
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:57,182
That depends whether you speak of
the Freehold at its height or at its fall.

91
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:03,188
Over a thousand dragons, a navy large
enough to span the seas of the world.

92
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,319
The glory of Old Valyria
will never be seen again.

93
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:12,656
Seven Hells.

94
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:31,592
- Tell me, how is Rhaenyra?
- What do you mean?

95
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:34,761
Well, these days, she doesn't say
more than a few words to me.

96
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,642
I think she might find it difficult
to discuss personal matters.

97
00:09:42,394 --> 00:09:44,271
It will take time.

98
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:48,108
It did when I lost mine own mother.

99
00:09:54,072 --> 00:09:56,241
I wish she would approach me.

100
00:09:57,618 --> 00:09:59,036
What if you went to her?

101
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,956
There are times when I would rather
face the Black Dread himself

102
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:04,750
than mine own daughter of fifteen.

103
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:10,505
I think she would open herself to you
if invited.

104
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:15,135
You do have such an easy way
about you, Your Grace.

105
00:10:19,431 --> 00:10:22,559
You do not mention our talks
to Rhaenyra, do you?

106
00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:29,733
I just... I fear that she wouldn't
understand them.

107
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:31,902
No, Your Grace

108
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:48,251
It's only been half a year
since my mother died.

109
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:51,838
But already, they tried to marry
my father off and replace me as heir.

110
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:54,549
I know those men and how they plot

111
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:57,761
in their secret councils
when I've been sent away.

112
00:10:57,886 --> 00:11:01,098
You cannot worry at the matters
of lords and kings, Rhaenyra.

113
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:06,186
And what if your father were to remarry?

114
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:16,071
Your father loves you.

115
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:24,246
He chose you for his heir.

116
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:27,791
He didn't choose me. He spurned Daemon.

117
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:47,477
Kneel with me.

118
00:12:04,369 --> 00:12:06,872
I find this is a way to be with my mother.

119
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:13,420
Here in the quiet of the Sept,
I feel close to her.

120
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:22,512
- I know it sounds foolish.
- I don't think it's foolish.

121
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,974
- I don't.
- Good.

122
00:12:29,227 --> 00:12:31,313
Because I thought you might try.

123
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:37,736
- I...
- If not for me, then perhaps for them.

124
00:13:03,595 --> 00:13:05,722
What do I say?

125
00:13:06,306 --> 00:13:11,019
Whatever you wish.
It's only for you and the gods to know.

126
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:49,349
I want him to see me as more
than his little girl.

127
00:13:52,018 --> 00:13:55,021
Mine own father does not know
the language of girls either.

128
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:04,906
When I wish to talk with him,
I know that I must make the effort.

129
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,287
Thank you.

130
00:14:21,673 --> 00:14:24,926
- Your Grace.
- I'm glad we could meet.

131
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,262
I know tempers ran hot today,

132
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:31,099
but I wanted to assure you how much
I value the bond between our houses.

133
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,977
Rhaenys is my favorite cousin, after all.

134
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:40,609
I wish to apologize for the tenor
at the small council today, Your Grace.

135
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:43,111
It was not my intent to make offense.

136
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:48,116
Your fleet is one of the realm's
most important assets, Lord Corlys.

137
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:52,287
But you must understand,
as king, it is my obligation to avoid war

138
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:54,539
until such time it is unavoidable.

139
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:57,500
None among us desire open war.

140
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:00,962
Might I speak plainly, Your Grace?

141
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:05,258
I always welcome the unfettered thoughts
of my council.

142
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:10,138
I fear that the eyes of our enemies
are presently fixed on the Red Keep.

143
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:12,349
The queen has passed.

144
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:16,019
A girl has been named heir to the
Iron Throne; the first in its history.

145
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:18,146
The king's brother so disinherited,

146
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,733
has claimed the Targaryen seat
on Dragons tone without challenge.

147
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:27,405
And now, a foreign power has established a
colony in our most critical shipping lane.

148
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:32,619
You paint such an aspirant portrait
of my reign, Lord Corlys.

149
00:15:32,744 --> 00:15:34,955
It is an honest one, cousin.

150
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:39,000
At the moment, the crown is perceived
as being vulnerable.

151
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:41,670
And a blind incursion in the Step stones

152
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:44,047
is the only way to demonstrate
that we are not?

153
00:15:44,172 --> 00:15:48,969
To elude a storm, you can either
sail into it or around it.

154
00:15:49,469 --> 00:15:51,680
But you must never await its coming.

155
00:15:53,473 --> 00:15:57,519
Do you have a specific course of action
to propose, my lord?

156
00:16:00,397 --> 00:16:02,274
Join our families.

157
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:07,737
Wed our daughter, Laena. Unite the
two great surviving Valyrian houses.

158
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:11,199
With the Targaryen dragons
and the Velaryon fleet bound in blood,

159
00:16:11,324 --> 00:16:16,579
you can show the realm that the crown's
strongest days are ahead, not behind.

160
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:26,464
I must admit, I haven't given marriage
much thought.

161
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:28,925
It hasn't even been half a year
since Aemma passed.

162
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,554
The realm expects you to take a new wife
soon or late, Your Grace,

163
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:35,390
to strengthen your line
and produce more heirs.

164
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,019
You could not ask for a stronger match
than Laena.

165
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:12,761
We haven't spoken much, since...

166
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:18,725
A regret of mine.

167
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:23,021
We should be free to speak our minds
to one another.

168
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,733
You can say whatever you'd like.
You are the king.

169
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:39,037
I loved your mother very much.

170
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:44,084
As did I.

171
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,478
Ser Harrold provided a fine field
of tourney knights.

172
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:05,063
Oh?

173
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:08,733
But in questioning them,
I discovered that Ser Criston

174
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:12,112
was the only man among them
with true battle experience.

175
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,573
He will make a fine
knight of the Kings guard.

176
00:18:21,329 --> 00:18:24,791
- Today at the small council...
- Pay it no mind.

177
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,544
- I thought I might have had some insight...
- You're young.

178
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,338
You will learn.

179
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:58,366
This is our best chance to save the digit,
Your Grace

180
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:05,331
The maggots will remove the dead flesh and,
hopefully, stop the advance of the rot.

181
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:16,050
I held an audience earlier today
with Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys.

182
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:18,303
That was most charitable
of you, Your Grace.

183
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:21,639
I'm Sure Lord Corlys appreciated
the spirit of it.

184
00:19:21,848 --> 00:19:23,933
He proposed a marriage.

185
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:29,355
- To whom, Your Grace?
- The Lady Laena.

186
00:19:30,523 --> 00:19:32,525
To combine the strength of our houses

187
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,988
and demonstrate my reign's strongest days
are ahead, not behind.

188
00:19:37,113 --> 00:19:39,866
Lord Corlys has overreached, Your Grace.

189
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,828
Such matters must be discussed
with the small council.

190
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:47,081
That is what I am doing, presently.

191
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:51,920
So, what is your advice, dear Otto?

192
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:57,675
The Lady Laena is young, Your Grace.

193
00:19:58,051 --> 00:20:03,097
Indeed. But the wounds made
by the Great Council still linger, My King.

194
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:08,394
A match with their daughter would go
a long way towards sealing the breach,

195
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:11,606
and uniting the two great Valyrian houses

196
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:16,694
would certainly signal unity
throughout the realm and beyond.

197
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:20,031
The Grand Maester's reasoning is sound.

198
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:23,535
I do fear what Rhaenyra might think.

199
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,578
What does it matter, Your Grace?

200
00:20:25,703 --> 00:20:30,542
Her mother has passed;
her father must propagate the royal line.

201
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:41,594
I dearly loved my own lady wife.

202
00:20:42,554 --> 00:20:45,848
The pain of her passing still haunts me.

203
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:53,022
And to be compelled to replace her,
for duty's sake...

204
00:20:54,816 --> 00:20:58,987
You are the king, but I do not envy you.

205
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:30,893
What was it like flying the Black Dread?

206
00:21:31,227 --> 00:21:34,063
You were Balerion's last rider.

207
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:37,692
Only for a short time. Before he died.

208
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:41,529
With Balerion died the last memory
of Valyria of Old.

209
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,034
But Vhagar still lives. Somewhere.

210
00:21:46,326 --> 00:21:48,620
But too large for the Dragon pit.

211
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:51,539
Some would say too large for our world.

212
00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:55,418
- Do you know where she nests?
- I'm sorry?

213
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:57,587
Do you know where Vhagar is now?

214
00:21:57,712 --> 00:22:02,467
Uh, the Dragon keepers believe she made home
somewhere on the coast of the Narrow Sea.

215
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:06,304
The workers at Spicetown
report hearing her song at times.

216
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:08,640
They say it is a sad thing.

217
00:22:10,683 --> 00:22:13,019
I imagine even dragons get lonely.

218
00:22:17,273 --> 00:22:18,650
Your Grace?

219
00:22:19,776 --> 00:22:25,573
It would be a great honor to join our
houses as they were in Old Valyria.

220
00:22:26,074 --> 00:22:29,285
I would give you many children
of pure Valyrian blood

221
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,997
so that we might strengthen
the royal line and the realm.

222
00:22:33,206 --> 00:22:35,500
Is that what your father told you to say?

223
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,799
What did your mother tell you?

224
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:47,053
That I wouldn't have to bed you
until I turn fourteen.

225
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,791
It bothers you, does it not?

226
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:23,548
My father is a king.

227
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:27,051
It is his duty to take a new wife
and strengthen his line.

228
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:30,154
I did not ask for a lesson in politics.
I asked whether this bothers you.

229
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,057
Laena is your daughter, princess.
Does it bother you?

230
00:23:34,517 --> 00:23:36,310
Of course it does.

231
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,565
But I understand the order of things.

232
00:23:42,608 --> 00:23:44,527
I'm not sure you do.

233
00:23:47,613 --> 00:23:50,867
If you mean to elicit some anger from me,

234
00:23:50,992 --> 00:23:54,036
you should know
that you are failing, princess.

235
00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:56,456
Quite the opposite.

236
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,437
Whether it is to my daughter
or to someone else's,

237
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:05,047
your father will remarry sooner than late.

238
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:07,675
His new wife will produce new heirs,

239
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,636
and chances are better than not
that one of those will be male.

240
00:24:10,762 --> 00:24:13,389
And when that boy comes of age
and your father has passed,

241
00:24:13,514 --> 00:24:17,518
the men of the realm will expect him
to be heir, not you.

242
00:24:20,396 --> 00:24:22,899
Because that is the order of things.

243
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:26,569
When I'm queen, I will create a new order.

244
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:30,948
How I wish that could be, Rhaenyra.

245
00:24:31,532 --> 00:24:33,910
But the men of the realm
already had their opportunity

246
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:37,580
to appoint a ruling queen at the
Great Council and they denied it.

247
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:41,209
They denied you, Princess Rhaenys.

248
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:43,961
"The Queen Who Never Was."

249
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:47,298
But they bent the knee to me
and called me "heir to the throne."

250
00:24:47,423 --> 00:24:50,593
Do you remind your father's men of that
as you carry their cups?

251
00:24:55,097 --> 00:24:59,894
Here is the hard truth which
no one else has the heart to tell you:

252
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:04,106
Men would sooner put the realm
to the torch

253
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:07,610
than see a woman
ascend the Iron Throne.

254
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:15,368
And your father is no fool.

255
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:32,009
The small council is urging me to remarry.

256
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:37,098
It seems the realm wants for a new queen.

257
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,314
A good and kind queen
will give comfort to your subjects.

258
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,406
Does the small council
have a particular lady in mind?

259
00:25:56,284 --> 00:26:00,329
Lord Corlys Velaryon has offered
the hand of his daughter,

260
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:02,623
the Lady Laena.

261
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,710
A very strong match, Your Grace.

262
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:11,173
I must admit.
I don't know Laena very well.

263
00:26:11,716 --> 00:26:15,928
I'm sure that she is good and kind
and that she will enjoy your company.

264
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:18,139
As I have, Your Grace.

265
00:26:33,237 --> 00:26:34,947
I brought you something.

266
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:57,428
I asked the stonemasons to mend it.

267
00:27:01,432 --> 00:27:07,188
This is a very kind gesture, Alicent.

268
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:12,234
Very kind.

269
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:21,285
Come.

270
00:27:24,163 --> 00:27:26,499
The Hand, Your Grace

271
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,048
Your Grace, I have called the small council
to an emergency session.

272
00:27:34,173 --> 00:27:35,549
Why?

273
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,136
I think it best you hear it directly.

274
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:41,555
Very well.

275
00:28:12,253 --> 00:28:15,131
- Daemon?
- The prince left a missive

276
00:28:15,256 --> 00:28:17,466
which I believe might explain.

277
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:22,763
"It is the pleasure of Daemon Targaryen,
the Prince of Dragons tone"

278
00:28:22,888 --> 00:28:27,059
"and rightful heir to the Iron Throne,"

279
00:28:27,184 --> 00:28:32,398
"to announce that he is to take a second
wife in the tradition of Old Valyria."

280
00:28:32,982 --> 00:28:37,403
"She is to assume the title
Lady Mysaria of Dragons tone."

281
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:42,616
"Her Grace is with child
and is to have a dragon's egg"

282
00:28:42,742 --> 00:28:48,164
"placed in the babe's cradle
in the custom of House Targaryen."

283
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:53,252
The Prince has invited you
to his wedding, Your Grace.

284
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:56,630
- It is in two days' time.
- Gods be good.

285
00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:58,841
Who is Lady Mysaria?

286
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:00,968
- We believe...
- Daemon's whore.

287
00:29:03,095 --> 00:29:06,140
- This is nothing less than sedition.
- I strongly agree, sire.

288
00:29:06,265 --> 00:29:08,934
My brother wishes to provoke me.

289
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:13,522
- To answer is to give him what he wants.
- The realm is watching, Your Grace.

290
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:16,567
What would you have me do?
Send him to the Wall?

291
00:29:17,777 --> 00:29:19,820
Perhaps could put his head on a spike.

292
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:21,781
Daemon has seized Dragons tone,

293
00:29:21,906 --> 00:29:24,658
has surrounded himself
with an army of Gold Cloaks,

294
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:26,744
and has now stolen a dangerous weapon.

295
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:28,954
"Which egg, Elder?"

296
00:29:54,688 --> 00:29:57,107
Assemble a detachment, Otto.

297
00:29:57,983 --> 00:30:00,236
I will go to Dragons tone
and drag Daemon back

298
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:02,279
- to face justice myself.
- Your Grace.

299
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:07,284
My apologies, Your Grace,
but I cannot allow it. It's too dangerous.

300
00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:09,703
Daemon is without limit.

301
00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:12,456
Let me go to Dragons tone.

302
00:30:39,608 --> 00:30:42,736
You're the most comely girl at court.

303
00:30:42,862 --> 00:30:45,406
Why do you destroy yourself?

304
00:30:46,156 --> 00:30:47,533
Hmm?

305
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:53,622
Will you see the king tonight?

306
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:57,960
If you wish it.

307
00:31:01,213 --> 00:31:03,465
- Good day, Ser Criston.
- My lady.

308
00:31:04,258 --> 00:31:07,219
I've assembled twenty of your
best household guards, my Lord Hand.

309
00:31:07,553 --> 00:31:09,680
Ser Harrold will also join us.

310
00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:16,312
Please look after the Hand, Ser Criston.

311
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:38,978
Welcome to Dragons tone, Otto.

312
00:32:41,397 --> 00:32:44,483
Your occupation of
this island is at an end.

313
00:32:45,484 --> 00:32:49,071
You are to relinquish the dragon's egg,
disband your "army,"

314
00:32:49,196 --> 00:32:51,073
banish your whore,

315
00:32:52,241 --> 00:32:55,160
and leave Dragons tone,
by order of His Grace, King Visery...

316
00:32:55,285 --> 00:32:57,246
Where is the king? I don't see him.

317
00:32:57,371 --> 00:33:01,375
His Grace would never lower himself
to entertain such a mummer's farce.

318
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,257
Ser Crispin, wasn't it?

319
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:12,094
- Ser Criston Cole, my prince.
- Ah, yes. Apologies. I couldn't recall.

320
00:33:12,469 --> 00:33:15,764
Perhaps my prince recalls
when I knocked him off his horse?

321
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:21,103
- Very good.
- This is a truly pathetic show, Daemon.

322
00:33:21,353 --> 00:33:23,230
Are you so desperate
for the king's attention

323
00:33:23,355 --> 00:33:26,150
that you've resorted to skulking about
like a common cut purse?

324
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:28,485
I'm simply keeping with the traditions
of my house.

325
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,362
The same as my brother did for his heir.

326
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:33,407
Those traditions
are for the true-born children of royalty,

327
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:36,618
not for bastards
fathered on a common whore.

328
00:33:36,952 --> 00:33:40,164
- Lady Mysaria is to be my wife.
- This is an abomination.

329
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:44,126
With every breath, you soil your name,
your house and your brother's reign.

330
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:47,337
Our love does not
know titles and traditions.

331
00:33:48,714 --> 00:33:52,634
And what of you, men of the City Watch,
aiding the prince in his treason?

332
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,346
The king made me their commander.
They are loyal to me.

333
00:33:57,139 --> 00:34:01,769
You've come for the egg. Here it is.

334
00:34:03,312 --> 00:34:06,315
Are you mad? You'd never survive this.

335
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,484
Well, happily, neither would you.

336
00:34:09,276 --> 00:34:14,073
To choose violence here
is to declare war against your king.

337
00:34:14,281 --> 00:34:15,699
Wonderful.

338
00:34:16,742 --> 00:34:20,704
Even if it ends in the death
of your unborn child and its mother?

339
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:03,122
All of you, sheathe the fucking steel!

340
00:36:10,022 --> 00:36:12,691
- What are you doing here, princess?
- Preventing bloodshed.

341
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:16,111
Ser Criston, please escort the princess
to safety.

342
00:36:16,236 --> 00:36:20,824
Take care not to startle Syrax, my lords.
She is rather protective of me.

343
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:13,043
I'm right here, uncle.

344
00:37:15,212 --> 00:37:20,259
The object of your ire.
The reason that you were disinherited.

345
00:37:20,842 --> 00:37:25,097
If you wish to be restored as heir,
you'll need to kill me.

346
00:37:26,056 --> 00:37:30,310
So do it, and be done with all this bother.

347
00:39:23,507 --> 00:39:26,093
You announced that we were to be wed?

348
00:39:27,552 --> 00:39:29,179
On the morrow.

349
00:39:30,764 --> 00:39:35,143
And that I was with child? Your child?

350
00:39:35,268 --> 00:39:38,480
Well, perhaps when we are wed,
we can make that true.

351
00:39:38,605 --> 00:39:42,484
I ensured long ago that would never
be threatened by childbirth.

352
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:45,445
Good. Children can be such
irritating creatures.

353
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:48,365
You swore to protect me, Daemon.

354
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:52,619
Dragons tone is quite secure.

355
00:39:54,538 --> 00:39:58,458
Until the king decides to reclaim
his ancestral seat.

356
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:01,920
His men might not put the prince's head
on a spike,

357
00:40:02,045 --> 00:40:04,214
but what would they do
with the "common whore"

358
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:06,925
he claims he's taken to wife
and made with child?

359
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,010
No one will harm you.

360
00:40:09,845 --> 00:40:13,723
I have been sold as property
more times than I care to count,

361
00:40:14,182 --> 00:40:17,602
beginning in a homeland
I can no longer recall.

362
00:40:18,937 --> 00:40:22,524
Most of my years have been spent
living in terror.

363
00:40:23,108 --> 00:40:26,611
- You're safe with me. I swear it.
- You are a Targaryen.

364
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:29,823
You can afford to play
your stupid games with the king.

365
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:32,534
But I cannot.

366
00:40:32,951 --> 00:40:38,623
I didn't come into your service
wanting gold or power or station.

367
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:43,545
- I came to you to be liberated.
- Liberated?

368
00:40:46,798 --> 00:40:50,552
- From what?
- Fear.

369
00:41:17,662 --> 00:41:19,998
No, please, Lord Lyonel.

370
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,173
I have come
looking for an unencumbered opinion.

371
00:41:28,298 --> 00:41:30,425
That's all I would ever give, Your Grace

372
00:41:31,635 --> 00:41:35,138
Ever since my name was read
by the archmaesters at the Great Council,

373
00:41:35,263 --> 00:41:38,558
I have felt Corlys Velaryon's envious gaze
staring at me

374
00:41:38,725 --> 00:41:40,727
from across the Blackwater.

375
00:41:41,228 --> 00:41:44,272
You sit upon the highest seat
in the realm, Your Grace.

376
00:41:44,731 --> 00:41:47,192
Proud men don't like having to look up.

377
00:41:51,071 --> 00:41:52,989
Laena Velaryon.

378
00:41:54,491 --> 00:41:57,160
Lord Corlys is your master of ships.

379
00:41:57,911 --> 00:42:01,665
And she is the eldest daughter
of the wealthiest house in the realm.

380
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:05,544
She comes from unimpeachable
Valyrian stock,

381
00:42:05,669 --> 00:42:09,631
and she has Targaryen blood.
What's to mislike?

382
00:42:09,756 --> 00:42:12,342
- She's twelve.
- She will mature.

383
00:42:15,428 --> 00:42:17,556
I never asked to remarry.

384
00:42:17,681 --> 00:42:23,103
As king, you have a claim on all things,
even those you don't want.

385
00:42:23,228 --> 00:42:26,022
Marriage is not an obligation
you can put off for long.

386
00:42:26,398 --> 00:42:28,817
What if was to reject
Lord Corlys's proposal?

387
00:42:29,192 --> 00:42:31,361
He would not be like to take it well.

388
00:42:32,028 --> 00:42:35,448
I fear nothing short of a direct line
to the Iron Throne would satisfy him.

389
00:42:36,658 --> 00:42:39,327
You should also consider
that we find ourselves

390
00:42:39,452 --> 00:42:42,080
on the precipice of war
in the Step stones.

391
00:42:42,497 --> 00:42:45,375
And the Sea Snake holds claim to
nearly half the realm's ships.

392
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,795
He would not dare withhold them
in the face of the realm's need.

393
00:42:50,046 --> 00:42:53,341
- Who is he to hector me?
- No one, Your Grace.

394
00:42:54,926 --> 00:42:58,680
But Driftmark makes for a better ally
than it does an enemy.

395
00:43:00,348 --> 00:43:04,769
The Sea Snake has made a calculated reach
a fair play for a man of his position.

396
00:43:07,188 --> 00:43:09,524
If you truly want my
"unencumbered opinion"...

397
00:43:09,649 --> 00:43:11,067
I do.

398
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:14,738
You should wed Laena Velaryon, Your Grace.

399
00:43:15,363 --> 00:43:20,368
Sate Lord Corlys and fix him at your side,
permanently, as an ally.

400
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:29,711
Your Grace. The princess
has returned from Dragons tone.

401
00:43:30,045 --> 00:43:31,838
Dragons tone?

402
00:43:51,691 --> 00:43:53,276
Your Grace.

403
00:43:56,863 --> 00:44:01,951
You disobeyed me.
You fled King's Landing without a word.

404
00:44:03,161 --> 00:44:06,414
And you acted without the crown's leave.

405
00:44:09,876 --> 00:44:14,798
You're my only heir,
you could have been killed!

406
00:44:18,885 --> 00:44:20,303
May I sit?

407
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:33,817
You went to Dragons tone.

408
00:44:34,109 --> 00:44:36,820
And retrieved the egg without bloodshed.

409
00:44:38,446 --> 00:44:41,533
A feat I'm not sure Ser Otto
could have accomplished alone.

410
00:44:44,744 --> 00:44:46,579
Yes. Well...

411
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:54,212
I sometimes forget how alike you both were.

412
00:45:04,431 --> 00:45:08,309
Your mother's absence is a wound
that will never heal.

413
00:45:09,936 --> 00:45:15,775
Without her, the Red Keep has lost a warmth
that I daresay it will never recover.

414
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:20,196
It pleases me to hear you say this.

415
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,578
To know that I'm not alone in my grief.

416
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:31,833
I wish I had known better
what to say to you in the aftermath.

417
00:45:34,627 --> 00:45:38,548
I struggled to realize that my daughter
had so quickly become a woman-grown.

418
00:45:42,552 --> 00:45:48,308
But I know she understands
what is now expected of me.

419
00:45:48,641 --> 00:45:50,852
The king must take a new wife.

420
00:45:56,065 --> 00:45:58,651
I could never replace your mother.

421
00:46:00,528 --> 00:46:03,239
No more than intend to replace you as heir.

422
00:46:04,574 --> 00:46:10,205
But you are my only heir. And our
line is vulnerable, too easily ended.

423
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:14,667
And by marrying again, I may begin
to ensure that we are better defended.

424
00:46:14,793 --> 00:46:18,254
- Against whom?
- Whomever may dare to challenge us.

425
00:46:24,969 --> 00:46:27,347
I do not wish to make us estranged.

426
00:46:28,348 --> 00:46:33,520
You are the king,
and so your first duty is to the realm.

427
00:46:37,065 --> 00:46:43,279
Mother would have understood this...
just as I do.

428
00:47:06,094 --> 00:47:09,681
It is little surprise. The iron
Islands follow no law but their own.

429
00:47:09,806 --> 00:47:11,432
We should levy a tax.

430
00:47:11,558 --> 00:47:14,602
You cannot solve every problem
in the realm with a tax, Lyman.

431
00:47:14,727 --> 00:47:18,189
I disagree. A well-aimed tax
can be stronger than an army.

432
00:47:18,356 --> 00:47:21,317
I propose we move our gold to Braavos,
Grand Maester,

433
00:47:21,442 --> 00:47:23,820
before Beesbury taxes it into dust.

434
00:47:30,201 --> 00:47:32,495
Good morrow, my lords.

435
00:47:43,381 --> 00:47:47,010
I have decided to take a new wife.

436
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:07,238
I intend to marry...

437
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:19,834
the Lady Alicent High tower
before spring's end.

438
00:48:26,507 --> 00:48:28,635
This is an absurdity.

439
00:48:29,302 --> 00:48:34,682
My house is Valyrian;
the greatest power in the realm.

440
00:48:35,642 --> 00:48:37,769
And I am your king.

441
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,628
Rhaenyra.

442
00:49:26,067 --> 00:49:29,654
House Velaryon's origins
reach back to Old Valyria.

443
00:49:31,656 --> 00:49:34,325
More ancient even than the House Targaryen,

444
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,162
according to some texts.

445
00:49:39,622 --> 00:49:44,460
But unlike the Targaryens,
we were no dragon lords.

446
00:49:45,712 --> 00:49:50,174
For centuries, my house had to scratch out
an existence from the sea

447
00:49:50,299 --> 00:49:52,760
with grit and luck.

448
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:59,809
When I ascended the Driftwood Throne,
I knew what I wanted.

449
00:50:02,228 --> 00:50:04,355
So I went out and seized it.

450
00:50:05,898 --> 00:50:10,319
Unlike every other lord of the realm,
I can say that I built my House's high seat

451
00:50:10,445 --> 00:50:13,239
with the strength of mine own back.

452
00:50:19,203 --> 00:50:23,624
I've always thought of you and I
as having been made from the same cloth.

453
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:35,470
I wasn't aware that you had a king
for a brother.

454
00:50:35,636 --> 00:50:38,848
We're both men who have had
to cut our own way through the world.

455
00:50:39,932 --> 00:50:43,227
We've been passed over. Too often.

456
00:50:45,772 --> 00:50:49,358
Did you call me to Driftmark to remind
me of my low standing, Lord Corlys?

457
00:50:49,484 --> 00:50:52,070
Or was there some other reason?

458
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:57,408
You've heard of the troubles
in the Step stones?

459
00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:04,582
"Some Myrish prince is feeding
Westerosi sailors to the crabs."

460
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:08,753
"I have been petitioning the king
to send my navy into the territory."

461
00:51:09,629 --> 00:51:11,172
But he has denied me.

462
00:51:11,297 --> 00:51:14,842
- It never was my brother's strongest trait.
- What?

463
00:51:16,302 --> 00:51:18,096
Being king.

464
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:25,645
"The Crabfeeder is backed by
powerful entities within the Free Cities"

465
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:29,148
"who wish to see Westeros weakened."

466
00:51:30,358 --> 00:51:33,444
"And the king's failures have allowed him
to accumulate strength."

467
00:51:35,905 --> 00:51:40,493
If those shipping lanes fall,
my house will be crippled.

468
00:51:41,744 --> 00:51:43,304
And I will not have Driftmark beggared

469
00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:47,625
while our king idles himself
with feasts and balls and tourneys.

470
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,586
I will speak of my brother as wish.

471
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:54,173
You will not.

472
00:51:57,635 --> 00:52:00,471
Waiting in the Step
stones is a chance for you

473
00:52:00,596 --> 00:52:03,724
to prove your worth
to any who might yet doubt it.

474
00:52:05,643 --> 00:52:08,729
We are the realm's second sons, Daemon.

475
00:52:09,647 --> 00:52:14,819
Our worth is not given; it must be made.

476
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:39,010
